jailskype
=========

Start skypeforlinux in a customized firejail.

Rationale
---------

I was never keen on Skype, but especially when Microsoft bought
it I avoided it at all costs and used SIP (& GTalk for the SIP-illiterate).
Unfortunately there are always the few people who refuse to consider
anything other than Skype (often they are the same people who will
only network with Facebook). When some of those people are ones
you *must* interact with for work-reasons, it gets a bit tricky.
Lately I noticed that Skype has started (about 10 years too late) to
support Linux in a way that is not so ridiculous, so I decided to
set it up in as sandboxed/crippled/blinded/impotent form as possible
for those moments when it is the only option left to me. I found [this
blogpost](https://spwhitton.name/blog/entry/firejailskype/) and built
on that, to have a user-friendly wrapper for running skypeforlinux in
a customized firejail.

Installation
------------

Ensure `firejail` is installed with a profile for `skypeforlinux` (the
latest Debian packages include the profile by default). Then copy
or symlink `jailskype` into your $PATH. To change the window-size of
the launched Xephyr screen edit the `xephyr-screen` value in the
firejail config (which is `/etc/firejail/firejail.config` for me in
Debian).

Quick Start
-----------

* `jailskype -h` for details.
