* for v0.1.1
    * How come skype logged-in state still (sometimes) gets maintained
      between this and non-jailed skype? (surely the logged-in state is
      stored locally, not remotely by IP, yet in a jail it should have no
      access to the local cookie/whatever).
    * Find an easy/simple way to auto-maximize skype within openbox on
      launch.
